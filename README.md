## Future

### Future Development

* fix history to update in realtime
  * currently, the history is updated in the database in the backend, but does not update until the page is refreshed
* fix adding guesses to database after the first guess
  * currently, the first guess is properly added to the database, but there is a bug that stops following guesses from being added properly to the database until the page is refreshed again
  * however, the front-end is still able to give and display responsive feedback after each guess
* fix adding feedback to database properly
* fix history bug when a guess or feedback is null
  * currently, there is a bug where the page is blank if we try to access the user history through the front-end when either a `guess` or `feedback` is `NULL`


## Usage

***If the page breaks when 'view history' is clicked, please refresh the page and click 'clear history and restart game' (see bug description above)***
